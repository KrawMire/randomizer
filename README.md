# Randomizer

Randomizer is a desktop application for generating random numbers. It doesn't use complicated cryptographic algorythms.

Imagine that you are a teacher and you want to selectively check your students' homework. So to be fair and don't make your students feel offended because of your choice, you can launch this application and delegate this (hard) work to it :)
